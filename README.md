# Undergraduate Research / Educational Content 
## Spatial Data Analytics, Geostatistics and Machine Learning in Python Jupyter Notebooks

A collection of Python demonstrations for spatial data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning methods authored by undergraduate students.

Students learning valuable skills while making content to support students learning valuable skills ...

* Interested in these great students for internships and full-time hires? Please see the contact information on the workflows!

As a professor, I am committed to providing early research experience for undergraduate students and to build out great educational content. 

* To learn about numerical models and machines, students need to be able to play with the models and machines!

Why do I share all of my educational content? Find out [here](https://medium.com/5-questions-with/why-its-important-that-professors-use-social-media-5-questions-with-associate-professor-michael-a921225287fb).

I use these demonstrations for:

1. in-lecture walkthroughs 
2. hands-on experiential learning with specific tasks suggested in the accompanying lecture notes
3. example workflows to support my students

I hope you find these resources useful. 

#### The Supervisor and Coauthor:

### Michael Pyrcz, Associate Professor, University of Texas at Austin 
*Novel Data Analytics, Geostatistics and Machine Learning Subsurface Solutions*

With over 17 years of experience in subsurface consulting, research and development, Michael has returned to academia driven by his passion for teaching and enthusiasm for enhancing engineers' and geoscientists' impact in subsurface resource development.

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope this content is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and / or consulting? I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!
